# Assignment

Assignment's purpose is to create a backend service that returns sensor data from the database.

# Solution

- A frontend with React, Typescript and Sass
- A backend with Node.js, Typescript, Express.js and Better SQLite3

---

#### To get started

1. Select technology you want to use
   - Node, Java, Scala, Python, C#, F#, Clojure
   - If you want use something that is not in the list, ask first
1. Reply to the email and tell us your technology choice
1. Execute `create_iot_db.py`
   - By default script creates 4 sensors with each 12,5M rows of data
   - Execution will take many minutes and database size is ~3GB
   - If you have some good reason why you can't execute a python file, we can provide you a download link for the database
1. Create your application

#### Functionality

Service should have these functionalities:

##### Sensor data summary

1. Get data from database table (_datas_)
1. Count amount of data per sensor and average temperature for each sensor
1. Return data in JSON format

```json
{
  "sensors": [
    { "id": "abba", "count": 12500000, "avgTemp": 21.43 },
    { "id": "acdc", "count": 12500000, "avgTemp": 19.75 },
    { "id": "iddqd", "count": 12500000, "avgTemp": 18.32 },
    { "id": "idkfa", "count": 12500000, "avgTemp": 25.46 }
  ]
}
```

**Note!** This has to work reasonably well with any table row count, be it 100k or 100M.

##### Internal new data service

1. Create an internal service, that fetches sensor data once per second from <http://dummy-sensors.azurewebsites.net/api/sensor/iddqd>
   - It is enough to get the data just for one sensor (e.g. iddqd)
1. Save data from this service to database's _datas_ table
1. Other components of the system should be able to access most recent datas it has requested
   - It's up to you to decide how to implement this particular functionality

##### Temperature difference

1. Get selected sensor's latest temperature
1. Get Helsinki's current temperature from <http://dummy-sensors.azurewebsites.net/api/weather>
1. Calculate the difference of these two values
1. Return data in JSON format

```json
{
  "differenceInCelsius": 14.56
}
```

**Note!** It is recommended to implement this in a way, that it works even if request to http://dummy-sensors.azurewebsites.net/api/weather would take a long time.

#### Architecture and design

> Important!
>
> Anyone can write (or copy/paste) basic small app, so remember to show your design/architecture skills

Imagine this application as a service which is part of a large-scale Enterprise??? Application that receives heavy load.

Other applications that would use this service

- JavaScript client
- Another application that uses this magnificent service's code base
  - Maybe as a Node module, Maven dependency, Class library or whatever it is called in that technology you selected to use.
  - Maybe there could be a client library that handles the communication between client and backend (your service).

Things to do:

1. Design a good architecture that will support this enterprise application scenario
1. Implement the interface so that _index.html_ can get data from the service
1. Remember to imagine this is application is part of huuuuuuge amount of other applications in an Enterprise??? environment.

> Important part once more!
>
> Use your design skills to show that you can implement a scalable system with modular architecture.

#### Frontend (optional)

_index.html_ is just a (bad)example of other application. Now it's time to improve it. Remember that this task is optional.

1. Create a simple frontend app with some modern JS-framework
1. Functionality
   1. App will have 2 pages (and navigation)
      1. Page 1: User must be able to fetch the summary of all sensors ([data summary](#sensor-data-summary))
      1. Page 2: User must be able to fetch the calculated difference between selected sensor and outside temperature ([temp difference](#temperature-difference))
   1. (optional) implement a simple login functionality in the frontend and backend

### Tips

- Make sure that the application starts
- Provide instructions how to run the app
